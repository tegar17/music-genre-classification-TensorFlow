# 🎵 Music Genre Classification (Deep Learning)

A deep learning project for classifying music genres using audio features and neural networks.  
This repository is part of my learning journey in Deep Learning for audio processing using Python and TensorFlow.

The project focuses on extracting MFCC features from audio files and training a CNN model to recognize different music genres.

## 📍 Background & Motivation

This project was created as part of my learning process in Deep Learning, especially in audio data processing.

I followed and learned from this YouTube playlist:

📺 [Valerio Velardo - The Sound of AI](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf)

Through this project, I explore how neural networks can understand sound patterns and classify music into different genres. My main goal is to gain hands-on experience with audio feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
